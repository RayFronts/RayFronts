querying:

  # If not set to null then text querying is enabled. If query is set to `prompts` 
  # then every line from the query file is considered as a prompt. If set to 
  # labels then every line will be considered as a label that will be injected 
  # into multiple prompt templates and averaged out to get the text embedding.
  text_query_mode: null # [null, "labels", "prompts"]

  # A query file used to initialize the list of queries will be used to query
  # the map periodically and visualizing the results.
  # The query file can be a .txt or .json file.
  # .txt: each line represents a query. If the query is a locally existing file
  # name, then it attempts to load that file as an image query. If no file 
  # exists, the query is assumed to be a text query.
  # .json: A dictionary where the query is the key and the value is a hex
  # color such that the query is colorized using that in the visualization.
